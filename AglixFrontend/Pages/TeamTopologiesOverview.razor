                        Team Topologies is an organizational model that helps you design and evolve your teams for fast flow. It emphasizes four team types
                        and three core interaction modes to help teams align effectively with the flow of work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Team Topologies focuses on enabling teams to work together efficiently, respecting clear boundaries, and utilizing the right interaction modes
                        for the problem at hand.

                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Types of Teams in Team Topologies" Icon="people">
                    <h4>Four Types of Teams:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Stream-aligned Team:</b> Responsible for a specific flow of work aligned with a business domain.</li>
                        <li><b>Enabling Team:</b> Helps stream-aligned teams acquire missing capabilities or overcome obstacles.</li>
                        <li><b>Complicated Subsystem Team:</b> Focuses on difficult areas requiring deep expertise, such as highly specialized algorithms.</li>
                        <li><b>Platform Team:</b> Provides internal services to other teams to help them deliver with less cognitive load.</li>
                    </ul>
                </RadzenAccordionItem>

                <!-- Interaction Modes in Team Topologies -->
                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Interaction Modes in Team Topologies" Icon="device_hub">
                    <h4>Three Core Interaction Modes:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Two or more teams work together for a defined period of time to discover new solutions.</li>
                        <li><b>X-as-a-Service:</b> One team provides a service to others (such as a platform) with well-defined APIs.</li>
                        <li><b>Facilitating:</b> An enabling team guides a stream-aligned team through the adoption of new tools, techniques, or approaches.</li>

                <!-- Common Pitfalls in Team Topologies -->
                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Common Pitfalls in Team Topologies" Icon="warning">
                    <p>
                        As with any model, there are common pitfalls to avoid in Team Topologies:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Ignoring Team Boundaries:</b> Not respecting the boundaries between different types of teams can lead to confusion and inefficiency.</li>
                        <li><b>Overusing Collaboration:</b> Collaboration is important, but too much of it can increase cognitive load and slow progress.</li>
                        <li><b>Failing to Evolve:</b> Teams and their interactions should evolve over time. Sticking to the same setup for too long can lead to stagnation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </RadzenAccordionItem>

                    <h4>Steps to Implement Team Topologies:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Assess Current Team Structure:</b> Identify if your current team setup aligns with the Team Topologies model.</li>
                        <li><b>Define Team Responsibilities:</b> Clearly define each team's role and responsibilities based on the four team types.</li>
                        <li><b>Introduce Interaction Modes:</b> Determine how different teams will interact, using collaboration, X-as-a-service, or facilitating.</li>
                        <li><b>Foster Evolution:</b> Ensure teams can evolve as the organization and products grow.</li>
