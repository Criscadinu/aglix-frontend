                    Scrum is an Agile framework designed to help teams deliver products iteratively. It allows teams to respond quickly to changes, adapt their processes, and ensure value delivery to the customer at frequent intervals.

                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Scrum Principles" Icon="lightbulb_outline">
                    Scrum principles are based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Teams use these principles to create a self-organizing, cross-functional structure that collaborates frequently and embraces changes.

                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Scrum Ceremonies" Icon="event">
                    Scrum has four key ceremonies:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A short meeting where the team discusses progress and impediments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> The team plans the work to be completed in the upcoming sprint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> A demo to stakeholders showcasing what the team completed in the sprint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> The team reflects on their process and seeks improvements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </RadzenAccordionItem>

                <RadzenAccordionItem Text="Common Pitfalls in Scrum" Icon="warning">
                    Avoid these common mistakes in Scrum:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Skipping Retrospectives:</strong> Neglecting retrospectives can prevent teams from improving processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overcommitting in Sprints:</strong> Taking on too much work leads to incomplete or poor-quality deliverables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Product Backlog Refinement:</strong> Failing to refine the backlog can lead to unclear requirements and scope creep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not Embracing Changes:</strong> Scrum requires flexibility. Sticking rigidly to a plan without adapting to new information can hinder progress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor Communication:</strong> Scrum thrives on collaboration. A lack of communication between team members can result in misunderstandings and misalignment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </RadzenAccordionItem>
